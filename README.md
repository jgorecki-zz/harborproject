# HarborProject v0.02

## This is a brute-force script for setting up an iOS Project, a Django Project, and the git repos for them.  Its highly specific to me and my workflow.  

### Warnings
- I don't recomment anyone use this because its not meant for public use right now.
- All required packages are installed on my machine.
- I frequently manually edit these files for specific projects, there is no telling where this is at.

### So anyways...
- Go ahead and look around but seriously, you shouldn't try and use it.  I'll be upgrading it soon.
